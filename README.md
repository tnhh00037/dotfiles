# Simple dotfiles to let you rock with terminal

## This is including some of essential programms/pluggin ( at least essential to me :D )
- zsh ( replace the old bash uncle )
- oh-my-zsh : great zsh pluggin, has a lot interesting `git` aliases.
- zsh-autosuggestion, zsh-highlight.
- lsd: a superb replacement for ls.
- autojump : great tool to appear in to a place without needing to remember the whole long path.
Basically I cannot live without it ( just type `j hatano` and .. poops :D )
    Ex : /hone/my_machine/study_document/math/new_folder/new_folder/new_folder/yui_hatano/MIRD-168.mp4
- tmux & tmux plugins.

## ATTENTION :
- Please read `install.sh` and delete/leave what you need ( Avoid overkill )
- Currently only available for linux
- Updating..
